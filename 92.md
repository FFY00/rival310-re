**(1) Example reply**
Like `90`, the mouse can reply to this command. Here's the reply I was able to get.
```
01 02 04 00 3B 00 35 50 FA 35 50 FA 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

We can clearly see the values `01`, `02` and `04` followed by the value `3B` and the a pattern that repeats two times, `35 50 FA`.

~~**Note**
This command seems to be sent by the driver after receiving the `48` command. The `90` command is also sent.
Order~~
```
MOUSE -> HOST | 48
250ms
HOST -> MOUSE | 92
~60ms
HOST -> MOUSE | 90
```
