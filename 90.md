# Full specification of the `90` command

**(0) Specification**

:---: | --- | ---
`0` | Command | `90`
`1-End` | Unknown | `00`

**(1) Reply**
The mouse should reply with the version.

Byte (Index) | Explanation | Values
:---: | --- | ---
`0` | Main Version | `01` (decimal `1`)
`1` | Sub Version | `21` (decimal `33`)
`2-End` | Unkown | `00`

This would mean the firmware version is `1.33`.

**Note** The order of the bytes can change. `0` could be the sub version and `1` could be the main version. Not sure why.



~~**Note**
This command seems to be sent by the driver after receiving the `48` command. The `92` command is also sent.
Order~~
```
MOUSE -> HOST | 48
250ms
HOST -> MOUSE | 92
~60ms
HOST -> MOUSE | 90
```
