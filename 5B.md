[This](https://gist.github.com/FFY00/faa3065a0fd39681143714c6272d90af#file-example-1-sh) will fade between the colors `#3151ff`, `#58ff36`, `#ff1ce5` and `#ffc13b` with a cycle duration of 5s.

[This](https://gist.github.com/FFY00/faa3065a0fd39681143714c6272d90af#file-example-2-sh) is the same as the example above but the cycle will restart when a button is clicked (any button).

[This](https://gist.github.com/FFY00/faa3065a0fd39681143714c6272d90af#file-example-3-sh) will set `#3151ff` as a steady color. The cycle duration will be 5s, but that doesn't really matter, and the cycle will not restart, again that also doesn't really matter. We only created 1 point at the position `0` so the color will not change.

**(1) Led ID**

`00` | Logo
`01` | Wheel

**(2) Repeat Cycle**

Value | Translation | Explanation
:---: | --- | ---
`00` | Repeat | When the cycle ends (`tick = 255`), it will restart (`tick` will be set to `0`).
`01` | Doesn't repeat | When the cycle ends, it will not restart again.

**Note** The cycle is defined later in the format of points. The cycle has a duration of 255 ticks. You can define points. Points are defined as the following:

```
Color |  Position Offset (how many ticks after the last defined point)
```

**(3) Trigger**
This is actually very simple. When one of the selected buttons is clicked, the cycle will start again (`tick` will be set to `0`).
